# Terminology %>% temporal data displays

* Wrapping: change x/y-coordinates of the data
    + x-wrapping: explore the regularity of the periodicity (`arrow left/right`)
    + y-wrapping: compare magnitude of peaks and troughs (`y`)
* Mirroring: vertically split series at a given value and reflects the bottom half
  across this axis (`f`)
* Switching: switch between line and area displays (`r`)
* Faceting: creates small multiples (`u/d`)
* Shifting: select and shift a series against another series (`m`)

All movements/interactions can be formulated into algebra.

# Linking %>% explore data

> Linking between plots builds a reactive brushing chain that when the data points
one one plot are brushed, then they are highlighted on all the plots.

* Multiple time series plot
* Parallel coordinate plot
    + Compute cognostics for every series
        - Strength of trend, weekday and weekend
        - Degree of spikiness
* Scatter plot
    + Strength of trend VS degree of spikiness
